### Abstract
Spermatozoa have a unique genome organization. Their chromatin is almost completely devoid of histones and is formed instead of protamines, which confer a high level of compaction and preserve paternal genome integrity until fertilization. Histone-to-protamine transition takes place in spermatids and is indispensable for the production of functional sperm. Here, we show that the H3K79-methyltransferase DOT1L controls spermatid chromatin remodeling and subsequent reorganization and compaction of the spermatozoon genome. Using a mouse model in which Dot1l is knocked-out (KO) in postnatal male germ cells, we found that Dot1l-KO sperm chromatin is less compact and has an abnormal content, characterized by the presence of transition proteins, immature protamine 2 forms and a higher level of histones. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses performed on spermatids reveal that Dot1l-KO modifies the chromatin prior to histone removal and leads to the deregulation of genes involved in flagellum formation and apoptosis during spermatid differentiation. As a consequence of these chromatin and gene expression defects, Dot1l-KO spermatozoa have less compact heads and are less motile, which results in impaired fertility
