# Summary
The H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L is involved in many biological processes, including development and mixed-lineage leukemias, but, despite a high expression in postmeiotic male germ cells, its role during spermatogenesis remained to date unknown. In the present study, we report that DOT1L is required for the production of functional spermatozoa. By multi-omics analyses performed on Dot1l knocked-out (KO) male germ cells, we show that DOT1L controls the widespread chromatin reorganization and compaction which take place towards the end of spermatogenesis, but also regulates mitochondrial metabolism, in particular acyl-CoA levels. Unexpectedly, we find that DOT1L interacts with pyruvate dehydrogenases, the mitochondrial enzymes involved in the conversion of pyruvate in acetyl-CoA; we also show that a significant proportion of pyruvate dehydrogenases is located in the nuclear compartment of male germ cells. Overall, our data demonstrate the critical role of DOT1L in chromatin and metabolism regulation during the differentiation of postmeiotic male germ cells.
